        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Structured Transformation:** The project successfully established a framework for converting natural language (e.g., \"Turn off the living room lights\") into a machine-readable JSON schema using keys such as `device`, `action`, `room`, and `setting`.\n",
        "*   **Prompt Engineering:** A robust system prompt was designed using few-shot examples to enforce strict JSON output and handle both binary actions (on/off) and numerical settings (temperature degrees).\n",
        "*   **API Readiness:** The `openai` library (version 2.21.0) was integrated with a `gpt-4o` configuration. While the simulation used a placeholder key, the logic was validated to handle multi-step commands by splitting them into distinct JSON objects.\n",
        "*   **Mock Implementation:** For the command \"Turn off the living room lights and set the heat to 72 degrees,\" the assistant successfully simulated a structured response containing two distinct action objects, demonstrating its ability to parse complex, multi-intent requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Error Handling:** Future iterations should include logic to handle ambiguous commands (e.g., \"turn it up\") where specific rooms or devices might be missing from the user input.\n",
        "*   **Real-time Integration:** The next step involves replacing the placeholder API key with a valid environment variable and connecting the JSON output to an actual IoT gateway or Home Assistant API for hardware control.\n"
